/// A helper trait for refcounted objects. Reccounted items can more easily be lifted into closures
/// without leaking data. This is accomplished by distinguising between "strong references" (cause
/// the object to exist) and "weak referenes" (which do not prevent the object from being freed).
///
/// There is a [refcounted!()](super::refcounted!) macro to make declaring such types easier. A new
/// strong reference can cheaply be created using the [Clone] trait.
///
/// Example usage:
///
/// ```ignore
/// let registry = core.registry();
/// // Generate a weak reference, so the closure does not force the object to be alive forever.
/// let registry_weak = registry.downgrade();
///
/// registry.add_listener(ProxyEvents {
///     // Use the some_closure!() macro to avoid this boilerplate
///     global: move |id, _perms, type_, version, props| {
///         let registry = registry_weak
///             .upgrade()
///             .expect("registry hook should not outlive registry");
///         let object = registry.bind(id, type_, version);
///         // ...
///     },
///     ..Default::default()
/// });
/// ```
///
/// The [closure!](crate::closure!) macro can be used to reduce the boilerplate of going through
/// the `downgrade()`/`upgrade()` cycle, especially for values that need to be sent into multiple
/// closures.
