# pipewire-native-rs

This is a native implementation of the [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org) client
library in Rust. The primary objective is to provide a safe, idiomatic API for
PipeWire clients, with a secondary goal of providing a C wrapper for clients in
other languages to benefit from the safety guarantees in the longer term.

Currently, support for connecting to a PipeWire server, enumerating objects,
and creating server-side objects is supported. Further work is required for
sending and receiving audio/video.

Being a work-in-progress, the API will likely change as we iterate.

Also included is `pw-browse`, a TUI tool to interact with PipeWire. This is
also under development, and will gain features as we make improvements to the
library.

## Documentation

Crate documentation can be found on
[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/pipewire-native/latest/pipewire_native/).

## Issues

Issues and suggestions for improvements can be submitted on the
[freedesktop.org
Gitlab](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire-native-rs).

## Code structure

At the top-level, we have a native implementation implementation of the
[PipeWire native
protocol](https://docs.pipewire.org/devel/page_native_protocol.html). This is
then exposed via the API in `pipewire/`, the entry point for this crate.

Similar to the C version, the `spa/` crate implements low-level primitives for
the PipeWire library.

There is a native implementation for some primitives, such as pod, for data
serialisation/deserialisation. There are also associated traits and macros (in
`macros/`) to reduce boilerplate.

A hybrid strategy is used for SPA plugins (which provide basic features such as
logging, event loops and a system call API). The SPA interfaces are exposed as
Rust interfaces, for use by Rust code. The underlying implementations use the C
plugin under the hood, with the option to be replaced by a Rust implementation
in the future if desired.

## Related Work

This project and draws inspiration from other efforts like the current Rust
bindings in [pipewire-rs](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire-rs)
and the
[pipewire-native-protocol](https://github.com/Troels51/pipewire-native-protocol)
implementation. The goal is for these bindings to eventually be the official
PipeWire Rust API.
